## Santa Project - Christmas 2022 Project

Associate Software Engineer Group Project - Aaron Matto, Terry Mills, Orkan Mustafa

## Requirements 

1.	He wants to be able to add or remove countries for deliveries, but wants those included in countries.json to exist by default. 

a.	No two countries should have the same name

b.	No two countries should have the same coordinates

2.	He wants to be able to increase or decrease the gift payload in KG for a given country and also be able to get the current payload.

3.	He wants to be able to add or remove reindeer from the rota, but wants those included in reindeer.json to exist by default. 
  
a.	No two reindeer should share the same name

4.	He wants to be able to edit the reindeer properties such as name, capacity, and range.

5.	Once he’s happy with the countries, his herd of reindeer, and the presents he needs to deliver, he wants to be able to generate an optimised delivery schedule for every country with the following constraints:
  
a.	His sleigh can be driven by at most 5 reindeer. 
  
b.	If he intends to visit a foggy country, at least one of the reindeer must have a shiny nose.
  
c.	Some nice-to-have stretch goals are:
  
i.	If possible and if capacity/range allows it, he’d like to visit multiple countries in the same trip.
  
ii.	Don’t use more reindeer than necessary in a given trip

6.	Santa should be able to retrieve this schedule at any time after this, but the schedule should not be recalculated unless a change is made to the total mass of presents, the countries, or the reindeer. Cloud compute in the North Pole is expensive.
